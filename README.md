# SQL and Pyhon Project: Canada Immigration


## Description: 
This project uses a real world dataset called Canada Immigration Data. The dataset has information about immigrants from many countries and their new destination, Canada where they reside. First, I downloaded the dataset to Visual Studio Code where I used Jupyter Notebooks to do all Python work. This included cleaning, exploring, processing and visualizing. Then, in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), I created a databas, then, I created a table and imported the .CSV file and created 15 SQL queries to explore the data. This project has 4 parts: First part, dataset folder which has .csv file for dataset. Second part is the python work, the third part is the analysis.sql which has the queries in it. The fourth part is a PDF that has images of the results of the queries. Feel free to explore this project and send any questions.
