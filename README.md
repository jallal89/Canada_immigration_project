# SQL and Pyhon Project: Canada Immigration


## Description: 
This project uses a real world dataset called Canada Immigration Data. The dataset has information about immigrants from many countries and their new destination, Canada where they reside. First, I downloaded the dataset to Visual Studio Code where I used Jupyter Notebooks to do all Python work. This included cleaning, exploring, processing and visualizing. Then, in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), I created a databas, then, I created a table and imported the .CSV file and created 15 SQL queries to explore the data. This project has 4 parts: First part, dataset folder which has .csv file for dataset. Second part is the python work, the third part is the analysis.sql which has the queries in it. The fourth part is a PDF that has images of the results of the queries. Feel free to explore this project and send any questions.  
## Languages Used:
- Python
- SQL
## Database and Tools Used:
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Visual Studio Code - Jupyter Notebooks
## Project Key Findings and Analysis:
- Canada appears to be among favorite destinations among immigrants, possible reasons include economy
- Countries like Afghanistan and India are where most of these immigrants come from
- From 1980s to 2013, there is an increasing trend of immigrants moving to Canada
- Most of immigrants come from Asia, Africa and many from Europe as well comparing to other continents
- Data shows that most of regions where these immigrants come from are developing areas
- 2012 was one of the most productive for numbers of immigrants, China 33024 immigrants, India 30933
- Graphs such as stacked plots, histograms and bar charts show how data can be better understood with visuals
- From Europe, most of immigrants come from places like Poland and Ukraine in recent years
- Conflicts, economic status, better education opportunies play massive role in immigration
- Visuals and data show Canada is likely to receive more immigrants in years to come, especially from places of conflicts
