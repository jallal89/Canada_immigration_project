# SQL and Pyhon Project: Canada Immigration


## Description: 
This project uses a dataset called Canada Immigration. The dataset has information about immigrants from many countries and their new destination, Canada where they reside. First, I downloaded the dataset to Visual Studio Code where I used Jupyter Notebooks to do all Python work. This included cleaning, exploring, processing and visualizing. Then, in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), I created a databas, then, I created a table and imported the .CSV file and created 15 SQL queries to explore the data. This project has 4 parts: Dataset folder which has .csv file for dataset. Second part is the python work, the third part is the analysis.sql which has the queries in it. The fourth part is a PDF that has images of the results of the queries. Feel free to explore this prioject and send any questions.
